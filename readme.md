Final Assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data

There are 3 files besides this one.

CodeBook.md - describes all the variables and transforms

run_analysis.R - R script that processes data downloaded and creates the file tidydata.txt

tidydata.txt - the final output: the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, 88 columns and 180 rows

Downloaded data is from here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

The data should be unzipped and in the working directory for the r script "run_analysis.R".

There is additional information on the dataset "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set"
here:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

This is not a dataset I would've chosen and is far too complicated and meaningless to me.
The descriptive variable names are awful, apologies.
